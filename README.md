## Exploratory data analysis

First peer-reviewed project in Exploratory Data Analysis (Coursera).
Goal: to reproduce the four plots in the figure folder with R.

For testing
1) get data from 
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:

* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.

2)run "load_data_househPowerCons.R" to preprocess the data and save a subset as "power-data.rds.
3) plot graphs by executing files "plot[1-4].R".
